The choice of Activation Functions (AF) has proven
to be an important factor that affects the performance of an
Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Use a 1-hidden layer neural
network model that adapts to the most suitable activation
function according to the data-set. The ANN model can learn for
itself the best AF to use by exploiting a flexible functional form,
k0 + k1 âˆ— x with parameters k0, k1 being learned from multiple
runs.

##  EXPECTED RESULTS
 A technical report containing implementation details (algorithm, initial settings such as sampling the parameters
k0, k1 from some distribution, parameter updates on
epochs, final parameter values at the end of training, train
vs test loss, train and test accuracy, F1-Score, plot of
the loss function vs. epochs,
